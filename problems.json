  "answer": "Cash the diamonds and hearts, then cash clubs to squeeze East in spades or clubs",
  "explanation": "Plan: declarer cashes all four diamond winners and the three heart winners (rectifying the count). East must keep guards in spades (Q T 9 8) and clubs (Q T 7 6). When declarer then cashes the two top clubs (A, K), East is forced to discard from spades or clubs. If East abandons a spade guard, dummy's J becomes good; if East abandons a club guard, dummy's J (or South's remaining club) becomes good. That produces the 12th trick."
