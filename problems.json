  "problem": "South is in 6♥. After drawing trumps, declarer can cash side-suit winners. East appears to be the only defender who can hold both spades and diamonds. How should declarer play to effect the simple squeeze?",
  "options": [
    "Draw trumps, then cash clubs and high side winners in the correct order to squeeze East",
    "Draw trumps, give up a small diamond to eliminate an entry, then claim",
    "Draw one trump, finesse spades through East, then run clubs",
    "Ruff two diamonds early to create an extra trick"
  ],
  "answer": "Draw trumps, then cash clubs and high side winners in the correct order to squeeze East",
  "explanation": "Plan: draw trumps (cash the heart ace and kings) so trumps are gone. Then run the established club winners (A, K, Q etc.) and other side winners from the two hands. East must follow and will be forced to discard a guard in either spades or diamonds. If East discards a spade, South's K becomes a winner (and North's A later); if East discards a diamond, North's Q becomes good. Proper order of running the side winners (after trumps) is what produces the squeeze."
